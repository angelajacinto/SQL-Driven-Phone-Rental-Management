# Project Overview

## Purpose
This project focuses on improving a phone rental system database by addressing data inconsistencies,  enhancing query performance, and ensuring better reporting. The company previously faced issues with data duplication, missing rental records, and difficulty retrieving insights.

## Old System
1. No proper relationships between tables such as missing foreign key constraints.  

2. Duplicate or missing records in the rental history.  

3. Rental costs had to be manually updated, leading to human errors.  

4. Difficulties tracking overdue rentals and revenue trends.  

## Implemented Solutions
1. Database Schema Redesign – Introduced better table relationships using foreign keys.  

2. Triggers for automation – Rental costs are now automatically calculated.  

3. New SQL Views – Easy reporting for rental history, top customers, and monthly revenue.  

4. Data Integrity Rules – Prevent duplicate rentals and ensure phones cannot be rented twice before return.
