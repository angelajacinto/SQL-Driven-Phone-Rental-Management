# Database Design

## Schema
The database consists of 4 main tables:
1. PhoneModel: Stores phone model details (e.g., iPhone 12, Galaxy S20) and associated costs.  
2. Phone: Tracks individual phones using IMEI numbers.  
3. Customer: Stores customer information  
4. rentalContract: Manages phone rentals, dates, and costs.     

## Relationships
1. Each phone belongs to a phone model.  
2. Each rental contract is linked to a customer and phone.  
3. Rental records are updated automatically when a phone is returned.  

## Constraints for Data Integrity
1. Foreign Keys: Prevent invalid references between tables.  
2. Triggers: Ensure rental cost is calculated automatically and correctly.  
3. IMEI Validation: Ensures only valid phone IMEIs are stored.
